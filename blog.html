                    </h3>
                    <p id="job_descr">Harnessing the combined power of artificial intelligence and image processing, computer vision has been a key component in the advancements of the field of computer science for years. I aim to discuss the impact it may have in the future. 
                        During my exploration of possible fields of computer science, computer vision caught my eye (no pun intended). The ability of machines to interpret visual data has been slowly improving, and eventually computers will be as good at seeing as humans. Specifically, this could transform healthcare. Imagine how many visits to the doctor could be optimized through a software that could pinpoint the problem on its own. Computer vision could also detect health conditions earlier, though routine scans, which in reality would be much cheaper than a visit to the doctor. In my own experience, I have seen many people reluctant to visit the doctor because it takes time and may be expensive depending on the outcome. With computer vision, we could offer a more low-level version of a checkup. Over time, this could detect changes in visual appearance and give us insights that doctors who see us twice a month cannot. 
                        I have yet to work with more low-level computer vision, but I have worked with high-level computer vision such as the OpenCV library. Working to train this model, I was able to create a facial recognizer. This is very interesting because the computer has to be able to analyze the video output through neural pathways the same way a human does. In reality, this is only touching the surface of what computer vision is capable of, but the project did provide me with insights of how to work with computer vision. Data quality is something that was surprisingly important in my opinion. For example, for facial recognition, you cannot take data from a single person, or single setting. Also, I learned that there are many pre-trained models, which save a ton of time when working. Online, there are many open source models trained on large data sets available. I have also learned, quite comically, that my laptop is not powerful to handle many of these models.
                        During a networking dinner set up by my technology and management class, I engaged in conversations of how artificial intelligence is changing every field. This led to our representative, working at Abbott laboratories, telling us how his work has been simplified through machines that can detect complications in blood. This is similar to computer vision, but in this case the sensor is not a camera. Once computer vision evolves, it will become widely used to simplify in every field, and I look forward to working with it.</p>
